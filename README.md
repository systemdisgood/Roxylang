# Roxylang
Macro assembly language for abstract machine that can do everything (it's Turing complete) using one basis logical operation (NOR, but it can be easily translated to NAND or something by third party utilities). It is the useful abstraction layer for ASIC development and FPGA programming. This machines can be used as cells of homogeneous computing environment, so the language supports this kind of functioning.
The Roxylang bitary file can compile assembly code into bytecode or execute bytecode.
